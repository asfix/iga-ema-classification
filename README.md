# Deep Learning for Celiac Diagnosis:Recognizing IgA Endomysial Antibody Tests Through EfficientNet Architectures

This study comprehensively evaluates the performanceof the EfficientNet and EfficientNetV2 architectures in binary, three-class and four-class classification
scenarios using immunofluorescence images. Our experiments on 254 clinical samples show exceptional performance, with EfficientNetV2-S achieving 99.37% accuracy in binary classification (positive/negative), 95.28% in three-class classification (negative, weak-positive, strong-positive), and 86.98% in the challenging four-class scenario involving ambiguous grey zone samples.

# Code Usage

This code is ready to be used without any command line parameters. Just change wandb_project_name for wandb project, data_directory for 5-fold cross-validatin train data folder.
